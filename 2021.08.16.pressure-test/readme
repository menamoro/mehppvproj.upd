Hi sir,

This file is just testing the pressure algorithm. I've tested it in my machine but after many iterations I found that it requires a really long equilibration time to reach a stable pressure, which is why I want to test it on your machine. To run please do:

$ pypresso pressure-test.py > pressure-test.log

so I can retrieve the result of the simulation. Thank you!
