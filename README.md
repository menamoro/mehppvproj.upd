Stored old code for bachelor's thesis; done prior to learning object-oriented programming

Includes python code using OpenMM for simulating "evaporation" (evap.py) 
As well as espresssoMD python code for setting up a system (i.e., assigning atom types, bonds, angles, and automatically assigning OPLS-AA parameters via graph traversal) and 
simulating pressure (although this failed, as we soon moved to OpenMM before completion)
